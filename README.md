## 👁️ What Is the Battlefield V Wallhack?

A **wallhack** is a cheat that allows you to see **enemy players, objectives, and objects** through all surfaces. It visually overlays boxes, skeletons, and markers to give you total intel on enemy positions—even before they spot you.

When combined with an aimbot or triggerbot, this becomes an unstoppable setup for **map-wide control**.
